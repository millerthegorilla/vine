<div id="pageinfo"><div id="metakeywords"></div><div class="pagetitle">La Goupiliere</div><div id="buttontitle"></div></div><span class='alltext'>La Goupiliere is a self-contained gite, which shares its garden with the owners’ holiday home. Constructed from the local white limestone - tufeau – it sleeps four people in two twin bedrooms. There is plenty of wardrobe and drawer space, all linen and towels are provided (these may be changed, on request, for stays of longer than a week), a stairgate is fitted, and a cot and highchair are also provided. Please note that due to the stairs the cottage is not suitable for people with physical disabilities.<br /><br />
There is private parking close to the house, reached via a bridge over a small stream. The kitchen/dining room has a washing machine, dishwasher, fridge/freezer, gas oven and hob, and all cutlery and crockery are provided.<br /><br />
There is a comfortable sitting room with tv (UK freesat), dvd player and radio, and a woodburning stove. The cottage is centrally heated, and water, electricity* and gas are inclusive, as is wifi.  A barbecue is provided. Up to two dogs are permitted, but there is an additional charge of £10 per dog for extra cleaning. The gite has its own garden area, with a gate to provide security for children and animals.<br /><br />
The gite is a few minutes walk from the centre of Fontevraud. There you can find a bakery/patisserie and a small grocery (epicerie) which also sells bread on a Monday, when the main bakery is closed. There are nine restaurants in the village (opening times vary) ranging from a basic bar to fine dining, and there are numerous others in the area. It is a scenic 20 minute drive to Saumur or Chinon, both beautiful towns with much to see.<br /><br />
