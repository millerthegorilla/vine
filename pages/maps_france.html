Approximate driving times from various ports are as follows: Caen 3 hours, St. Malo 3 ½ hours, Cherbourg 4 ½ hours, Calais 6 hours. 
There are good train services to Saumur from Paris, and there are three airports within easy reach, Angers, Poitiers, and Tours, where car hire is available.<br />When travelling from St Malo, there is a good road via the ring road at Rennes, to Le Mans and then one can take the motorway from there to Saumur, or head through the pleasant countryside and avoid the motorway altogether.</span>
